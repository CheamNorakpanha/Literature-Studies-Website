                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U left China with two of his friends Kim and Seng. They left China to
                                    find a job so that they could earn more money and send it back to their family. The
                                    first letter shows us that Suang U is a runaway boy who left his hometown to follow his
                                    dream. He is going to Thailand because his friend Seng got a letter from his uncle
                                    telling him that it is easy to start a business in Thailand, and with the earnings of
                                    the business, he would have enough money to send home to his mother and also have enough
                                    left over to live off. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">The letter shows that Suang U truly loves his mother, and as you can read,
                                    he pleads for forgiveness. Suang U tells his mother about a nice man that everybody
                                    likes who is on the boat with him. He has a square face and strong features. Lo Yong
                                    Chua talked to Saung U about whether Suang U can read or write. If Suang U can read,
                                    Yong Chua might be able to find Suang U a job. Suang U's mother taught Suang U to write.
                                </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Lo Yong Chua promised to find Suang U's job as a bookkeeper for his cousin
                                    Lo Nguan Thong. Saung U mentioned how his dad passed away, and Yong Chua mentioned how
                                    he lost his family. They bonded, and Nguan Thong asked if Saung U wanted to be his son.
                                    Saung U agreed, but he made it clear that he would keep his sae "Tan." </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U and Seng then get into a fight because Seng insulted Suang U's new
                                    Dad. Seng uses homophobic language toward Lo Yong Chua. Saung U punched Kim to show who
                                    the real man is.</p>

                                    told his uncle that the two friends betrayed him, and he turned his back on them. Suang
                                    U and Kim realized that they wouldn't get a job from Tae Lim; however, his father got

                                    the coolies like drinking. Whenever they get their money, they always spend it on
                                    drinking and not on their wives and family. Suang U wants to respect Thai people, but he
                                    can't find any qualities to respect them. At their learning session today, Suang U was
                                    afraid that the jade bracelet may be the cause of the trouble. Ang Buai brings up the

                                    being a wife in the future. Speaking of getting married, Nguang Thong told Mui Eng that
                                    his friend Lim (Seng's uncle) wants Mui Eng to be with Seng. </p>

                                    Buai and bullies her (she holds back her tears, please don't tell anyone), so Suang U
                                    asks Kim not to leave her alone. Later on, Mui Eng questioned why Suang U helped Ang
                                    Buai even when Suang was sick. Mui Eng got mad. So, Mui Eng runs to her father's house
                                    and starts shouting Ang Buai's name. Mui Eng was jealous of Ang Buai and said that her
                                    sister flirts with her husband. Ang Buai mentioned how Mui Eng threw herself at Suang U.
                                    Ang Buai admitted that she had seen her sister throw the jade bracelet. Suang U warns
                                    her that he'll get a new Thai wife from the bar.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">The Autumnal Feast Day is coming, and Suang U's and his adoptive father's
                                    business is doing well due to the customers given by his father-in-law, so everyone is
                                    exhausted. However, Suang U feels a little guilty about being profited from his
                                    father-in-law's business. What bothers him the most now is having to pay his alien tax
                                    to the government since the government officials are very corrupt and have bad
                                    attitudes.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Two months later, the new business that Ang Buai manages is doing well, and
                                    Suang U kind of likes the new store also when he visits the store, but Muy Eng does not
                                    want to visit her parents since she's embarrassed about her appearance. These days, he
                                    starts to argue a lot with his wife about their future and raising children. While Muy
                                    Eng wants fewer children, her husband wants more, and he's very mad when she brings up
                                    the idea of what he calls "the devil's medicine".</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Finally, the birth of the baby is coming soon, and Suang U is frustrated and
                                    drunk and even bothers the midwife from time to time since she does not allow him to see
                                    his wife in labor. He starts to emphasize the pain his wife is going through. In the
                                    end, the baby has arrived, and he's happy that it's a boy.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">His son is healthy, while his father-in-law is very ill. Before his death,
                                    his coffin and his funeral are handled by Ang Buai, and despite her success he still
                                    wants his younger daughter to get married. His last wish is to teach the next generation
                                    to love their cultures and traditions. Finally, he dies five days before the New Year's
                                    Day. When it comes to the mother-in-law's announcement about her husband's will, Ang
                                    Buai gets a bigger share since it includes the business also, so when Muy Eng gets home,
                                    she's furious about the fact that her husband left her son with nothing and suggest that
                                    they should use it for the factory that Yong Chua is always talking about.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Everything is more expensive now that the war is over, and the father and
                                    son decide on the investment in the factory. However, the process is costly and
                                    time-consuming, but he convinces his father that they will earn it back later on. His
                                    father believes that it is better to sell the products at a low price, which does not
                                    rip off their customers and attracts more. Eventually, their business is almost fully
                                    set up and its name is "Loet Rot" in Thai and <b>"Lo Buan Chai Heng"</b> in Chinese, but
                                    he continues working to sustain his father-in-law's business.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Kim has been seeing a girl, named "Chaba", who works in Muy Eng's store. He
                                    asks her to marry him, and Suang U promises to help him out. Now, Suang U and his wife
                                    are expecting a second child. After the wedding, Suang U and Kim fight over whether
                                    their family still lives in the village in China. There's also another fight, between
                                    Suang U and his wife, about him helping Kim start his own business. One day, Chaba's
                                    father dies, and Suang U is very curious about the Thai funeral.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Weng Khim starts walking and spends so much time with Kim and his wife who
                                    cook Thai food for the family, but Suang U doesn't seem to like it, and he mostly
                                    complains about the food, even the radios, which always advertise products, and the new
                                    hairstyles. The second baby is coming named Chui Kim. Suang U again complains about the
                                    Thai baby clothing and decides to buy his wife a sewing machine, but her sister gets a
                                    new car which everyone enjoys except Suang U and his mother-in-law.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U is mad at Kim for gambling, and they are angry at each other because
                                    Thai joked about the Chinese being stingy. He no longer trusts Kim. He’s thinking of
                                    moving to live near the factory, but his business might be lost to Seng whom he hates.
                                    He visits Li San to transfer the accounts of customers and gets to sell his boats. There
                                    is a shop (bakery) for sale, and everyone is moving. The third grandchild is on the way.
                                </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Seng and Suang U finally let everything out (the dirt, the jealousy, and the
                                    stop). We learn that Kim and Chaba are not here anymore. Mui Eng is looking for new help
                                    that she can trust because the old one steals her stuff but gets caught by the police.
                                    (Suang U’s surprised by the police work). The business is not doing well, and the father
                                    is trying to explain using logic while Thaokae Nia and Mui Eng explain using
                                    superstition, which causes Mui Eng to argue with Ang Buai</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">The 3rd child is here and named Bak Li (not as strong). Weng Khim begins to
                                    be naughty even Sai cannot stand. Suang U takes him to see Kim and Chaba with a baby
                                    girl with a gift of gold. They start to talk about Seng’s upcoming wedding. While the
                                    business is doing well, Suang U worries about Weng Khim learning Thai, and he believes
                                    that it is okay to learn Thai, but Weng Khim should remember that he is Chinese.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Weng Khim is pretty much scheduled and controlled by Suang U, so he likes
                                    Ang Buai, who sometimes picks him up from school. Everyone gets the invitation to Seng’s
                                    wedding (married to a friend of Ang Buai’s). The fourth child is coming, and Mui Eng
                                    fell in the bathroom, so she cannot have any more children. The fourth baby is a girl,
                                    and Suang U is very upset, and he’s drinking.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">A houseful of girls. How does a man raise a houseful of girls these days?
                                    Look at their aunt! (Or their mother, throwing a bracelet through the kitchen window to
                                    her father’s penniless clerk.) How much worse will it be in fifteen years? Boat (mother)
                                    or oar (baby), but he doesn’t even want the oar. Suang U complains about Thai people’s
                                    irresponsibility and backstabbing each other, but he sees a young boy who works hard
                                    named Iu Kieng.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Mui Eng decides to name the baby girl Meng Chu, which Suang U shows no
                                    interest in. Suang U noticed that Mui Eng is getting older physically, and he smokes
                                    now. He’s seen his first movie kids’ Problem in the theater. He learned about beggars
                                    and renting babies. People! Whatever is the matter with them? For a few coins. some
                                    would debase themselves that far. Were they brought up with no religious training at
                                    all? Do they feel no shame? I never in my life heard of anything so vile as stealing
                                    infants to rent them out. How lazy can a man let a baby earn his rice? Even cripples do
                                    useful work, those who are determined and have self-respect. I have seen legless men do
                                    an honest day’s work with their hands.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">He went to the shrine with Mui Eng and saw the opera company where kids grew
                                    up not knowing Thai. According to my informant, it is not an atmosphere of employer and
                                    employees, but a family that looks to grandfather for advice and authority and rewards
                                    justly due. What could be more sensible? He meets the ‘freak.’</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U is working on his Thai for better business and living, but only when
                                    his kids are not there, and he also begins to be interested in Thai literature (read his
                                    kid's books and novels). He learned about China's news and allowed his first daughter
                                    Chui Kim to go to school. Weng Khim complains about learning Chinese but is good at
                                    math. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Weng Khim changed a lot to be more troublesome, according to Suang U. He
                                    learned more problems about China and many things about the government. He's upset that
                                    Mui Eng badmouths about his mom in front of his kids. Since Weng Khim failed the exam,
                                    he's bashing the school for not valuing customer service skills, and the school
                                    encourages students to work something better than their parents' jobs. (Look down on
                                    people who do not send their children to school, and then complain about the school).
                                </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">The business is doing well to the point they cannot cater to the demand.
                                    Weng Khim gets a fever (pneumonia) from playing in the rain, and Yong Chua volunteers to
                                    look after him. When the kid gets better, Yong Chua gets worse. The doctor wants him to
                                    eat something more nutritious, not the sick man's diet. Then, he dies. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">He decides to integrate Thai culture into his father's funeral (he calls it
                                    Buddhist tradition). Now he's sick, and he's working too hard. He always has the same
                                    nightmare (everyone dies, and he grins). Kim visited him and talked about his new
                                    restaurant and Chaba's hemorrhoid, then bashed Thai food.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Mui Eng wants a car, and everyone loves it except Suang U, so she uses her
                                    father's money to buy it. His definition of happiness and Hers and Weng Khim's. Chui Kim
                                    is good at housework, and Weng Khim is good at the store. Meng Chu kind of looks like
                                    Suang U's Mom.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Weng Khim quits Thai school and only studies Chinese with a Teacher from
                                    Shanghai. Who caused the girl to say such things to WK? Chui Kim is doing very well at
                                    school. And the breakfast table conversation is disastrous. Bak Li wants to be the
                                    beauty queen. And what's wrong with that? He starts to fall in love with his youngest

                                    Pekingnese dog as an apology gift. There is a story of a man beating up his mother which
                                    disgusts Suang U. Moreover, this makes Suang U miss his mother even more and want to
                                    take care of her. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">The children wanted to stop eating rice from the rice bowl, and they wanted
                                    to use knives, forks, and plates like their friends. Suang U rejected. Ang Buai wears a
                                    new kind of sarong (hoop skirt). It's belted at the waist and flares out at the bottom
                                    like a bamboo basket. Suang U thinks that it is a waste of cloth. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Weng Khim asks permission to go to his friend's birthday, and he also wants
                                    to celebrate one too. Suang U likes Meng Chu. Without chatting with her for one day, he
                                    feels like it's not a warm day for him. Suang U buys an expensive TV which surprises
                                    everyone because he spent money on something. Before buying the TV, Suang U made all the
                                    children promise not to spend too much time on the TV. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Kim and Seng take Suang U out to a club for the first time in Suang U's
                                    life. Suang U visits Kim's restaurant to talk to his old friend and catch up with each
                                    other about what's going on in their life. Suang U wanted to set up Kha Hieng with Weng

                                    relations between China and Thailand are not good which creates trouble for Suang U's
                                    business. A man contacts Suang U to join him in smuggling goods into Thailand which can
                                    make a lot of profits. Suang U rejected.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U was offered a directorship in the Society of Chinese Merchants. The
                                    name of the members must be Thai, so most Chinese people apply for citizenship for the
                                    kids. One day, the parents arrange a meeting between Weng Khim and Rose, but he doesn't
                                    like her due to her appearance and cursing, but Mui Eng thinks that cursing is loving in
                                    some families. However, All Weng Khim wants is a brother, so Kim suggests Suang U have
                                    another wife.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Society has changed a lot, and children are no longer obligated to take care
                                    of their parents, which makes Suang U afraid of loneliness in old age. Now he's in Hua
                                    Hin. He feels uncomfortable with women's fashion and how young people behave, so he is
                                    worried about the kids, who grow up so fast, and Meng Chu grows to be more like her
                                    aunt. There have been some fire incidents that caused millions worth of damage, and
                                    hundreds of homes were lost maybe due to tenants being evicted or insurance money. So
                                    now there is a stricter law and penalty for arson and selling of heroin, and now there
                                    is even a public execution.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Due to the recession, the business is not doing well either, but Suang U
                                    believes the reason might be the change in customer's taste. Everyone follows the Farang
                                    and Japanese cultures. Family members are no longer entertained by one another but
                                    instead by television, movies, opera, and massage parlors.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Meng Chu wants to stay in school but her father denies so she refuses to go
                                    back home. Ang Buai argues with Suang U about keeping Meng Chu and hurts his feelings
                                    about not wanting her in the first place.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U's hope to return to China seems to be impossible day by day due to
                                    the fear of being arrested and the thought of the difficult lifestyle in China. The
                                    regulations are tougher now, and only big firms are capable enough to petition for
                                    exclusive national control of particular products, so Suang U can't compete with them.
                                    Sadly, he loses some money to "Len Share", an investment plan. There are more ways to
                                    make money now by withdrawing large sums of money from a bank to lend it at a very high
                                    rate, which seems to be unethical, and by the Indian "selling on time" scheme that
                                    allows you to pay a certain amount of money every month with some interests. Weng Khim
                                    is smoking now, which causes some conflicts with his father.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U again feels uncomfortable with the new women's fashion sense and
                                    plastic surgeries, and again everyone is nagging about Ang Buai's marriage until she
                                    spills some of her secrets about a short guy she likes.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Weng Khim now stops smoking but all the girls are now very into the new
                                    fashion and trend. One day, his kids all go to change their names legally. While the
                                    government is involved in changing the surname, the kids are allowed to choose their own
                                    given names.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">One day he sees Chui Kim talking with a boy and he is furious. What makes
                                    him angrier is the fact that Chui Kim is sponsored to compete in a beauty pageant.
                                    Surprisingly, he lectures the girls about how good his sister-in-law is as a
                                    businesswoman and not someone who abuses her freedom. Now the business and the market
                                    are more competitive as they have promotions and advertisements such as a lucky draw,
                                    quite similar to gambling, which was illegal at the time.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Chui Kim will be married soon to Seng Huat, who is very picky about his
                                    future wife but falls in love with Chui Kim the moment he sees her. Unfortunately,
                                    according to tradition, the bride's family does not go to the wedding. However, Ang Buai
                                    managed to do so with the kids. Bak Li came back home from the wedding with some stories
                                    of the practices that seemed weird to everyone in the house.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U starts to worry about his other children's future such as the
                                    military draft and different ways to get his son out of it his Meng Chu now worries
                                    about her school, and he surprisingly becomes very supportive of her education and her
                                    goals. Weng Khim has become a big disaster for the family. He is drunk every night as
                                    Meng Chu reports, and after his father confronts him, he leaves the house with his mom's
                                    jewelry. He is also drunk with "fun" at his age. His parents go from place to place to
                                    find him, but they have no luck. One day, he gets to meet Huang, Weng Khim's friend, so
                                    he finally gets to see Weng Khim with a 10-year-old prostitute named Phanni, whom he is
                                    madly in love with. However, Suang U does not bring him home. Suang U seems to be more
                                    lenient towards Weng Khim this time, while Mui Eng cannot accept the fact that a
                                    prostitute might be her daughter-in-law. Suang U offers to take Phanni and his son in
                                    together and even gets his daughters to stay together in one room to make a great room
                                    for the lovebirds. He thinks of it as an investment to get his son back.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Phanni has difficulty fitting in with the family: the laundry, the wake-up,
                                    and the TV, and even Meng Chu creates a blackout to get her to sleep early. Eventually,
                                    she tries to fit in by doing her laundry and Weng Khim's, and Mui Eng starts to accept
                                    that this is her Karma. Kim is madly trying to return the dowry to Suang U. Phanni
                                    leaves the house with Mui Eng's jewelry, and Weng Khim still supports Phanni.</p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Meng Chu talks to her father about whether he will allow her to get paid for
                                    her job, and Suang U learns that Bak Li has a boyfriend named "Surasak". Meng Chu and
                                    Suang U continue to debate his perspective on the Thai people. Weng Khim is infected
                                    with an STD and has been taking some medicine. He finally bursts out his anger and talks
                                    about his difficulty fitting in the crowd while most Chinese boys are abusing their
                                    wealth (he never gets what he wants). </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Bak Li is pregnant and needs to get married. After the suggestion from Ang
                                    Buai, and the insult from Chui Kim, Bak Li's father needs to pay for the wedding, while
                                    Surasak stingily pays for the food. He even asks his mom to move in, who is very stingy
                                    as well, and she does not even do laundry regularly. Mui Eng dies in an accident on
                                    their way to the beach because they hire their driver. Meng Chu suggests cremating her
                                    mom and spending the money for charity, although his friends frown upon it. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">On the funeral day, one of Meng Chu's friends catches his eye. Suang U
                                    agrees to buy the white dress for Rose for her wedding, but she takes it too generously,
                                    which surprises him. Suang U tends to consult with Meng Chu a lot since she is the only
                                    one left in the house, and she even suggests he marry Ang Buai. Suang U tends to worry
                                    about children's love and respect for their parents, and people tend to frown upon the
                                    fact that Suang U has been writing to his mom for 20 years, but only Winyu understands.
                                </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Winyu is smarter than most men SU knows, and he gets to teach SU about
                                    racism. Meng Chu is marrying Winyu no matter what. She sees marriage as a test of her
                                    relationship, which pisses Suang UU off, and also the fact that he's Thai. His mom pays
                                    a visit (Thai and Chinese are cousins) and witnesses Bak Li's scene. Suang U plans to
                                    move out since the house reminds him too much of the old times, and now Meng Chu has a
                                    job that pays more than her husband. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U learns about Meng Chu's wedding from Ang Buai, who also learns that
                                    Suang U will give out bank books to his children while Meng Chu's kept with Ang Buai.
                                    Suang U moves to Thonburi and learns more about Thai and how Chinese children marry
                                    Thais, and even his neighbor persuades him not to live alone. One day, Meng Chu visits
                                    him, and he learns that her husband helps her with housework, and he's shocked. </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">There is a fire in Thonburi, and everyone is shocked, which headlines
                                    (dramatically) the newspapers. People are helping and stealing, and Winyu and Ang Buai
                                    come to help Suang U. Now Weng Khim and Rose persuade him to come back to live with
                                    them. Rose has been very stingy with her employees, which irritates Suang U. She tends
                                    to spend her money lavishly on her husband and herself, so Suang U goes to visit Chui
                                    Kim and has some great talks about the drawbacks of a Thai marriage license (Chui Kim
                                    does not need to ask her husband to buy land). </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U lives in Chui Kim's house. Weng Khim becomes very ungrateful. He
                                    said this about Suang U behind his back. <b><u>Damn that fire in Thonburi ... I haven't
                                        had an
                                        night's peaceful sleep since. One lousy year of freedom, and bang! here he was,
                                        pushing
                                        up the thermostat in our refrigerator. I admit that you were right-but don't
                                        keep
                                        nagging me about it, all right?"</u></b></p>

                                <p className="fs-5">And the next morning, he said something nice to his father's face.
                                    <b><u>"Why do
                                        you have to leave us and live with Chui Kim, Papa? Everyone will talk . .. I
                                        mean, how
                                        does it look? All your old cronies will think well, you know living with a
                                        daughter and
                                        all ... " "Are you afraid of losing face, then?" I asked, fastening the lock on
                                        my
                                        trunk. "I'm worried about you, room, of course. But let's face it, Papa, you
                                        could go
                                        back to that place in Thonburi if you wanted to. You liked it over there, didn't
                                        you?
                                        Why do you have to look at me like that?"</u></b>
                                </p>

                                <p className="fs-5">Suang U moves to live with Meng Chu and Bak Li visits. Winyu teaches Suang U
                                    again about Thai (farm). Suang U wants to rent a shop, and Khun Surasang helps. Suang U
                                    ended by renting a place to have a small business and stay with Meng Chu. At the end of
                                    the story, Suang U has learned so many things, including the fact that money is
                                    everything. He also regrets that he should have treated his son differently. He also
                                    agreed to get married to Ang Buai, so he asked Meng Chu to talk to Ang Buai about it.
