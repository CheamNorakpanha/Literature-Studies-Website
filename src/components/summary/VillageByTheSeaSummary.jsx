                {/* paragraph 1 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>The novel's action takes place in a fishing village near the sea named Thul, located in a
                    rural area in India. The novel follows the life of a small family forced to live in poverty. The parents
                    are unable to take care of their four children—the mother is sick with an unknown illness and the father
                    is given to drink and dissolution—so the oldest two, Lila and Hari, assume the roles of adults in the
                    house. Lila takes care of her mother and takes care of the house while her brother works in the fields
                    to financially sustain his family.

                {/* paragraph 2 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>The family ended up in this situation after Lila, Hari, Kamal, and Belu's father were
                    tricked into believing that if he paid a large sum of money, someone would find him a job in Goa. The
                    man ran away with the money, and the father stopped working and started drinking excessively, which put
                    a strain on the family.
                </motion.p>

                {/* paragraph 3 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>Hari begins to think about better ways in which he could help his family and believes their
                    prospects might get better when he hears that a factory will be built in their village. All of Hari's
                    friends are excited, but Hari tries to have a more realistic view of whether he will find work in the
                    factory.</motion.p>

                {/* paragraph 4 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>Their situation changes a bit when the de Silva family comes into the village. They are a
                    rich family who vacations at their seaside home several times a year, and they always employ the
                    children. Lila and Hari start helping them and become their servants. After finding out about their
                    situation, Mr. de Silva offers Hari a job in Bombay as a car washer. At first, Hari is suspicious of his
                    offer but then analyzes his situation and reaches the conclusion that Lila will never be able to find a
                    good husband without money and that it is now his responsibility to provide for his family.

                {/* paragraph 5 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>The factory man begins to cause a stir when he tells Hari and other villagers about the
                    major changes the fertilizer factory will bring: jobs for skilled people, land set aside for houses for
                    the thousands who will flood in, the removal of rice and other crops, etc. This causes consternation
                    among the villagers, and soon a protest begins to form. A group of men led by the charismatic Adarkar
                    decide to go to Bombay to speak with the government.

                {/* paragraph 6 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>Hari is roused by the words of Adarkar and decides to go to Bombay to stand up for his
                    people. He does not tell his sisters. When he arrives in Bombay, he is stunned by the city—its
                    buildings, its crowds, the smells and noises, the cars. He listens to Adarkar and other speakers, but
                    quickly realizes he has no role to play. All of a sudden, he is aware of his impetuosity for coming
                    here, and he feels very alone. He remembers Mr. de Silva's offer and manages to find the residence, but
                    the rude servant tells him that de Silvas is not in town. A kindly watchman tells him he will take him
                    to his friend Jagu.

                {/* paragraph 7 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>Jagu agrees to let Hari work in his restaurant, so Hari sends home a postcard letting his
                    sisters know where he is and that he is going to bring his earnings to them. Life is hard for Hari in
                    Bombay, but he works hard. While working for Jagu, Hari meets Mr. Panwallah, who takes Hari under his
                    wing and starts to teach him how to make watches and how to repair them.

                {/* paragraph 8 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>During the time Hari is in Bombay, Lila finds succor from the de Silva family. When they
                    come for their vacation, Lila works for them. She asks Mr. de Silva to take her mother to the hospital
                    when she hears he is driving that way, and he immediately agrees and says he will take care of
                    everything. When Lila's father hears of this, he yells at her in a drunken rage, but he goes to the
                    hospital and remains by his wife's side. He also gives up drinking and is much more subdued. Lila visits
                    every week, and her mother improves more and more. The de Silvas depart, but another guest stays in the
                    home—a venerable political leader studying birds that, coincidentally, Hari heard speak in Bombay. He is
                    quiet and kind and pays the girls well.

                {/* paragraph 9 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>Monsoon season is hard for both Hari in Bombay and the villagers by the sea. When Hari hears
                    on the radio that fishing boats out of Alibagh were lost in a storm, he decides he must return home. He
                    knows he belongs with his family by the sea. He decides to go to Diwali and continues to learn the
                    watchmaking trade from Mr. Panwallah in the interim.
                </motion.p>

                {/* paragraph 10 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>Hari returns and has an emotional reunion with his sisters. He is stunned to hear of his
                    mother's improvement and his father's sobriety. He tells Lila that he has decided to start a small
                    business raising animals while thinking that he will open his watch shop in the future; both business
                    options are good for when the factory crowds come. Hari visits his mother in the hospital and is
                    thrilled to see that the years of illness have passed. His father also seems pleased to see him in his
                    gruff way. Hari and his father can take Mother home for Diwali.
                </motion.p>

                {/* paragraph 11 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>The celebrations are delightful and heartwarming for the family. Hari slips away for a
                    moment during the preparations to see the man at the Mon Repos. He talks with him briefly about bird
                    watching and suddenly realizes that he is Sayyid Ali, the impassioned speaker from Bombay. Ali is like
                    Mr. Panwallah but expresses sadness about the changes coming to Alibagh. Hari tells him what he is
                    doing, and Ali perks up, admiring Hari's will to adapt.

                {/* paragraph 12 */}
                <motion.p className="fs-5 pb-2" {...fadeUp}>The story ends with the family contentedly celebrating, grateful for the positive changes in
                    their lives.
